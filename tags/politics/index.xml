      <description>Before anyone complains about me getting political on what was mainly a tch site, remember that not being political is a luxury that only people not getting screwed by the current political landscape can afford.
In no particular order, the attempts to roll back rights for LGBTQ+ citizens, the assaults on womens&#39; rights, the handling of the COVID-19 crisis, packing the Supreme Court with a hypocritical last second Justice, putting kids in cages, the ongoing destruction of the political norms that have existed for decades, the ignoring scientific facts, etc, etc all have focused my efforts on supporting one party.</description>
