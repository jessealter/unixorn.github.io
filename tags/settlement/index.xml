      <description>Get your money from the Equifax settlement regarding the 2017 security breach.
 Eligibility check site Settlement Site  Your settlement options are to take a few months of their shitty credit monitoring that costs them nothing to provide, or to collect $125 you can spend anywhere on things that are actually of value to you.
In addition to the $125, if you spent up to 10 hours doing things like resetting all your passwords, setting up credit freezes, checking your bank accounts, credit cards, stock trading sites &amp;amp; etc for fraudulent transactions, you can get some extra money to compensate you for all that wasted time without having to submit paperwork to them about it.</description>
